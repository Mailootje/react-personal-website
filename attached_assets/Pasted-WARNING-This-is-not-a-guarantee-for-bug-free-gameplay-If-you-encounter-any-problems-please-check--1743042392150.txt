WARNING! This is not a guarantee for bug-free gameplay! If you encounter any problems, please check again on a clean profile with only ProMods enabled. If the problem still persists, please file a report in the Troubleshooting & Support section. Otherwise please find out which mod is responsible for your problem and contact the creator(s) of said mod.

There are a few maps compatible with ProMods. Those which we are aware of (and actually make sense to be combined in terms of quality and main goal) are listed and linked below and should work together well in the given load order. If you experience any errors, please try again on a clean profile with only ProMods and those maps enabled. In case you have a shifted world map it usually helps to put the ProMods Def package (with RusMap compatibility checked) at highest priority. If your problem persists, please open a new topic in Troubleshooting & Support/Gameplay Issues and describe your problem including your game.log.txt. There are a few map mods which we do not support and the discussion and support of which we forbid on our forums due to piracy and mod theft. You will find some examples of those below as well. If we have forgotten a map, please give us a note in the corresponding Discussion thread.
